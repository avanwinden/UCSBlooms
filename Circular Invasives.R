#Question: Do the non-native species act differently than the native species?
#do we need to pair? look at literature review and see how the comparisons are presented 

# for invasive is peak the metric to look at or should early bloom be a better indicator? Maybe both?
#could see that peak isn't much different but that invasives satrt to bloom earlier. (pretty sure thats what the literature review in general was finding)
