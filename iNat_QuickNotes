UCSBlooms project first observation was March 11,2019 last was September 29,2021
Main year of project was March 11,2019 to March 17,2020

Of all iNat observations submitted within the same geograohic space and time frame of the blooms 
project the top species were plants (very similar to UCSBlooms list of top species) and the 
first non-plant species was the Honey Bee at 99 observations. 

UCSBlooms project accounts for APPROX 65% of plant and 46% of all observations during the 
same time and geographic area

Lab group made 3,331 observations. 5 people account for 56.69% of the observations 
in the UCSBlooms project
Withing the 1st year of the project lab group accounts for 70% of the observations 
Lab group defined as: Angela, Taylor, Michelle, Charlie, and Jagger

700 of the 1134 are in some bloom stage (3,4,5,or 6) accounts for 61% of the species observed
128 of the 149 poppy are in some bloom stage, accounts for 86% of the individuals observed
138/262 of the hawthron are in some bloom stage, accounts for 53% of th eindincduals 

Looking at the histogram of all observations and then observations of focal species there is 
for sure a difference in the patterns. 
circular data supports this. mean is for all 5.6 degrees and for focal -23? 
the circualr data shows that the mean ob date for focal species is feb 23 2020 and the mean ob date for all species is march 16 2019
very consisent with what the histogram shows!
